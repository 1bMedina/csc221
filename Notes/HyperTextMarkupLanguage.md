# Lesson 5, HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

## HTML - Part One
- HTML is used to make the DOM
- HTML uses tags to show text (ex. <>)
- HTML was invented in the early 1990s
- Browsers used to be extremly flexible when it comes to HTML
- You must follow the syntax rules in newer HTML

## HTML - Part Two
- The structure of HTML is -
	- Doctype
	- Html
	- Head
	- Body
- index.html is usually the deafult file name
- Usually start with <> and end with </>
- Html comments start with <!-- and end with -->
- There are ordered and unordered lists
- Tables are no longer used as CSS replaced it

## HTML - Sample Code Walkthrough
- The developer tools shows the DOM not the raw code
- The browser respects spaces when using the pre tag
- The pre tag also prints everything in monospace font
- There is space that the paragraph tag has already made
- To make a link open in a new tag you can do target="_blank"
- Tables are no longer used
- The DOM is prettier
- The DOM fixes many mistakes in the source code and shows it in the developer tools but does not actually change the source code
